# Overview

The Software I wrote is a google extention that allows me to have a changing wallpaper at google.com. 

The reason I wrote this is because currrently Google allows you to add a theme or/and a background image, but I wanted a slide show, so every time I went to the website, I would get a different image. I felt it would alow me to have a more unique experience online.

# Future Work

* I would like to use pictures on my own personal computer instead of online images.
* I would like this extention to change the new tab background and not just the google search background. It's weird that they are indeed different websites.
* I may want to add a feature that people can add photos through the extension. This way I could post my extension to the public.
